GPS Location Mapping with Google APIs
Project Description
This project leverages the power of the Google Geolocation API to create a GPS location tracking and route-mapping system. The application allows users to:

Track their real-time geolocation and store their positional data over time in a PostgreSQL database.
Generate routes from the userâ€™s current location to a desired destination using Google Maps.
The system is built using modern web development technologies, including JavaScript, PHP, and the Apache server, alongside a robust PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval.

Features
1. Real-Time Geolocation Tracking
Utilizes the Google Geolocation API to retrieve the user's current latitude and longitude.
Stores positional data in a PostgreSQL database to monitor user movements over time.
2. Route Mapping
Allows users to search for and generate the best route from their location to a specified point.
Integration with Google Maps ensures accurate and real-time navigation information.
3. Responsive Design
Designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices.
